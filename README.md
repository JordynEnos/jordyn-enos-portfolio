# jordyn-enos-portfolio

The purpose of this project is to create a portfolio page that showcases my work samples & allows potential employers to assess my skills & suitability for open positions. The portfolio page was built using HTML & CSS. 

## Repository Description

1. Adjusted the :root color scheme, font-color, text-shadow, & background colors for the header, h1, h2, & nav bar

2. Implemented a 'target' attribute to the Resume hyperlink so that it directs the user to a new page when they view the personal resume

3. Added leftheader & rightheader classes to evenly distribute the profile image & subtitle within the hero-banner

4. All 'nav' links are functional & the UI scrolls to the corresponding section when clicked

5. The Surf Report application image is larger in size than the other images under the Work section

6. When the images are clicked, the user is taken to the deployed application

7. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens, the user is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport
