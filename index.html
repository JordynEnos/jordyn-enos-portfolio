      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          My path to engineering has been a bit unconventional, starting out as a strength coach & then transitioning into Tech Sales. 
        <p>
          As a coach, I refined my skills around basic sales principles, rapport & retention, & creating programs to develop client potential. During this time, I experienced an insatiable curiosity around learning & implementing repeatable sales frameworks. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s when I transitioned into Tech, where I joined an AU based company selling RegTech software to hospitals & skilled nursing facilities. In this role, I immersed myself in the processes of finding PMF & developing GTM strategies, while executing sales frameworks like commercial teaching & tailoring for resonance. This experience reinforced my belief that connection & having a deep understanding of unique customer needs are the shortest path to sales success. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Working toward PMF, I collaborated cross-functionally with our PMM, Product, Customer Success, & Engineering teams. The insight into their respective roles offered me a new perspective, I didn’t want to just sell the product - I wanted to build the damn thing. This led me to pivot & enroll in UCLA for software engineering, where I worked hard to develop my technical skills. I also leveraged my unique experience in sales to bring a customer-centric perspective to the software development process.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, I get to combine my passion for innovative systems with my desire to help people. I thoroughly enjoy projects that effect real, meaningful change in people’s lives, & love being part of a collaborative team that is dedicated to creating solutions to complex problems. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, I believe my background in training & business development offers a unique perspective & skill set that I can apply to ensuring solutions are built through the lens of the consumer.
